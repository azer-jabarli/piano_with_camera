# piano_with_camera

A python project which allows you to play 7 sounds of the corresponding notes with the tip of your index finger. Notes are, basically, do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-si. You just need a working camera and a bit of light for the program to detect your hand.

NOTE: The performance of the script heavily depends on the parameters and general productivity of your device. Do not forget to download necessary libraries before running.

Have fun!
